# NR-IQA-for-MD-images-based-on-PC
In the paper, we proposed a no-reference (NR) IQA method with image structure based on multi-scale phase congruency for multiply-distorted images. The underlying principle of the method is that distortions not only destroy image low-level features, but also disorder the distribution of these features, to both of which human vision system(HVS) is highly sensitive.
